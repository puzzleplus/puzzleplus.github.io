  <h3>A bit of Puzzle+ History</h3>
  <p>Puzzle+ has had a long and circuitous journey. Here's the story:</p>

  <h4>2007-2008</h4>
  <p><a href="https://www.erat.org/">Dan Erat</a> and <a
  href="http://neugierig.org/">Evan Martin</a> create <a
href="https://github.com/martine/lmnopuz">lmnopuz</a>, with a JavaScript frontend and a
Ruby backend.
  The service works, but there's no good place to host it.</p>

  <h4>2009</h4>
  <p>After learning about Wave, <a href="http://danvk.org/">danvk</a> remembers
  lmnopuz and writes the code to store crossword state in a wave. Work is
  abandoned after the realization that there's no way to access uploaded files
  via JavaScript, a crucial feature of lmnowave.</p>

  <h4>2010</h4>
  <p>After going on a hike with <a
  href="http://www.eseidel.com/work.html">another developer</a>, danvk learns
that Firefox 3.6 has added support for the HTML5 File API. lmnowave is now
possible! Hacking resumes! The project is <a
href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/2010-03-22/introducing-lmnowave/">first
released</a> in March.</p>

  <h4>2011</h4>
  <p>Wave is canceled, but <a href="http://douweosinga.com/projects">Douwe Osinga</a> spins the Wave Gadgets API (and hence "lmnowave") into <a href="http://googlewave.blogspot.com/2010/12/announcing-google-shared-spaces.html">its own product</a> called
<a
  href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/12/google-shared-spaces.html">Google
  Shared Spaces</a>, a service on Google Labs. danvk <a href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/2011-03-27/crosscountry-crosswords/">ports the project over</a> and
changes the name back to lmnopuz.</p>

  <h4>2012</h4>
  <p>Google Shared Spaces is killed/morphed into the <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/getting-started">Google+
    Hangouts API</a>. The project is rebranded as "puzzle+" and <a href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/2012-05-17/puzzle-crosswords-for-google/">re-released</a>.
  <a href="https://github.com/danvk/lonely">Lonely Hangouts</a> is also
  developed and <a
  href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/2012-06-25/lonely-hangouts/">released</a> to
speed up iteration on multiplayer scenarios.</p>
